This are the instructions for assignment 2 (for my own reference):
📝 Option 1
Assignment: "Job Application Webpage".

A screenshot showing an example of the expected HTML webpage output is provided below at the end of the page.

 

📝 Option 2
You may also develop a website based on your own idea but it MUST have the required structure described in this hands on assignment instructions.

🎯 Objective
Design a fictional job application webpage using HTML. The form should collect applicant information and demonstrate your understanding of form elements, attributes, and semantic HTML structure.

📌 Instructions
You are tasked with creating a job application form for a fictional employer and role. Your website is required to have the following structure and content below.

✅ Required Structure and Content
Each of the listed HTML elements and tags MUST be demonstrated at least once in your code. You may use them multiple times if it makes sense for your design. You can add additional elements and tags that you see fit for creating your website as long as the minimum requirements are met.

1. Structure & Layout
Use <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer> to organize your content.

Include a <style> block or style attributes to apply basic inline CSS.

Use class to group and style elements.

Add a <blockquote> with a motivational quote about careers or success.

2. Create Form
Use the <form> element with:

action attribute (e.g., action="/submit").
method attribute (POST for sensitive data).
Inside the form, include:

3. Text Inputs
<input type="text"> for full name and email.

Use name, placeholder, required, minlength, maxlength, and pattern attributes.

4. Password Field
<input type="password"> for account creation or login.

5. Number Input
<input type="number"> for years of experience.

Use min and max attributes.

6. Range Slider
<input type="range"> for expected salary range.

Use min, max, and step.

Note! Displaying values for the range slider is not required for this assignment, since it involves JavaScript, which is outside the scope of this course. However, if you want to learn how it can be done, visit the links below.
